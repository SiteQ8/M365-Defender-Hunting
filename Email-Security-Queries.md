## üìã Query Deployment Guidelines

### Performance Optimization
- **Time Range**: Most queries use 24h for real-time monitoring
- **Result Limiting**: Add `| take 1000` for queries that might return large result sets  
- **Indexing**: Filter on Timestamp first, then other indexed fields
- **Joins**: Use appropriate join types and limit join scope when possible

### Customization Requirements
1. **Domain Names**: Replace "company.com" with your organization's domain
2. **Thresholds**: Adjust numerical thresholds based on your email volume
3. **Exclusions**: Add legitimate senders and services to exclusion lists
4. **Time Zones**: Modify after-hours detection based on your timezone

### Detection Rule Creation
```kql
// Template for converting to detection rule
EmailEvents
| where Timestamp > ago(1h)  // Adjust frequency as needed
| [your query logic here]
| project 
    Timestamp,
    AlertTitle = "Email Security Alert",
    AlertSeverity = "Medium", 
    RecipientEmailAddress,
    SenderFromAddress,
    Subject,
    ThreatIndicators = "Suspicious Email Pattern"
```

---

*These queries provide comprehensive email security monitoring capabilities. Regular tuning and customization for your environment will improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.*
